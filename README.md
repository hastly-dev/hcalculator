# HCalculator
Helps to perform simple calculations without leaving Minecraft

Permissions:
    hcalculator.reload - Allows to reload the plugin.

The next argument after the /hcalculator command is required to enter the first number. The second argument is followed by the calculation sign. And finally the third argument is the second number.

Aliases:
    /calc
    /hcalc

The plugin is very simple, a lot of functionality was not planned for it :)
